In Stock Market Prediction, the aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. Machine learning itself employs different models to make prediction easier and authentic. This project focuses on the use of machine Learning Algorithms like Linear Regression and Moving Average , Decision Tree to predict stock values. Factors considered are open, close, low, high and volume.
Algorithms used - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Moving average
